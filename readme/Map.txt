Map is interface.
think of it is like a dictionary.
where we have some word and its value.
In java map is object , that has key with value , cannot contain duplicates , each key have atmost 1 value,
key unique but value may be duplicate, it is unordered.
key can be null.

In map if key is not present than its value is null by default.

method:
1. put(key,value): to put key and value in map.
2. get(key): to get a value of a particular key.
3. containsKey(key): used to check that the key is present or not.
4. containsValue(value): used to check that the value is present or not in map.
5. keySet(): it return set of key from map.
6. remove(key): remove key value from map. or you can write remove(key,value) to delete particular entry.

time complexity:
get and put both have o(1) tc.
